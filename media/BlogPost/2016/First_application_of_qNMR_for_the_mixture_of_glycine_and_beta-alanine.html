<p>Follow last blog about qNMR, now this blog shows the demo about how to quantitative analysis using NMR spectroscopic tools. Here, we quantified the content of the mixture included glycine and alanine...</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>You can referece the last post about what's qNMR. Here we will shows How's qNMR.</p>
<h2>2. Experimental</h2>
<p>1H NMR experiments were carried out using Bruker 5mm CPBBO spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz, 298K. The typical acquisition parameters optimized for qNMR were as follows: bruker pulse program <code>zg30</code>, acquisition time 2.73s, sweep width 12019.2 Hz, relaxation delay 10s( this parameter must be optimized, and more than five times the longest T1 ). 64k data points after 32 scans, and an exponential line-broadening function of 0.3 Hz applied to FID.</p>
<h2>3. Materials</h2>
<p>59.21mg of Glycine ( Sangon Biotech, 99%) and 53.49mg of $\beta$-Alanine ( Sangon Biotech 98.5%) were accurately weighed by a Sartorius analytical balances with a readability 0.01 mg, and transferred into an 5mm NMR tube (Schott NMR sample tubes), with adding $D\_2O$ solvent( 99.9% purity with TMS).</p>
<h2>3. Results and Discussion</h2>

<p>As qNMR's theory, the intensity of the 1H signal is directly proportional to the number of protons that give rise to the signal, as following:</p>
$$
  \frac{number-of-proton-in-glycine-NH2}{number-of-proton-in-beta-Alanine-CH2} = 
  \frac{59.21mg/75.07}{53.40mg/89.09} \simeq \frac{100}{(75.3427+75.3822)/2}
