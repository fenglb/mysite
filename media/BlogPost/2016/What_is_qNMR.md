qNMR is quantitative NMR spctroscopy for the purity determination of organic molecules, based on the signal intensity is in direct proportionality with the number of protons contributing to the resonance.

###Pro
* Fast and non-destructive method;
* Reproducibility;

###Con
* low quantification limit;
* contaminates ( electronic referencing approaches have been used in an attempt )

###Good qNMR results: 
1. Weighing of the reference and the sample prior to the qNMR measurements must be done with utmost accuracy. 
  High-precision weighing and sample preparation. 
  United States Pharmacopeia(USP) dictates a maximum uncertatinty error of 0.10%.
2. the reference substance and the sample must no react with each other or with the solvent.
3. S/N > 150 (using cryoprobe, using high field magnetic, more scans);
4. long enough relaxtion delay $\frac{7}{3} \bullet T\_1$;

###Requirements to qNMR calibration standards

1. only substances with a very limited number of signals and of highest organic purity.
2. stable in solution and should not be chemically reactive.
3. they should not contain residual water.[ the presence of water can lead to line broadening or baseline distortion in many case]
4. solid reference should not be hhygroscopic and a liquid reference should not be volatile. (they must be no change in weighing value of greater than 0.02mg over a time period of 10min)[1][weber2014]
5. a 1:1 signal intensity ratio of sample and internal standard is targeted.
6. not overlay
7. neither extremely toxic nor carcinogenic or mutagenic

This pdf shows their nmr peaks, Certified Standards for [quantitative NMR](http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/china-mainland/zh/analytical-chromatography/analytical-standards/application-area-technique/organiccrm.html) The company **SIGMA-ALDRICH** offer a set of NIST traceable certified reference materials for use as internal standards in qNMR studies.

###Methods
1. internal reference method;
2. external referencing approaches comprise NMR-tubes with coaxial inserts leading to a separation of analyte and standard;
3. electronic reference methods, e.g. ERETIC(Electronic Referencing to access in vivo Concentrations), PIG(Puls Into Gradient, ARTSI(Amplitude-corrected Referencing Through Signal Injection), QUANTAS(Quantification by Artificial Signal);

###Theory
The intensity of the NMR signal is directly proportional to the number of protons that give rise to the signal. The purity determination of a substance can be calculated as follow:

$$ 
  P_x = \frac{N_{std} \bullet I_x \bullet MW_x \bullet m_{std} }{ N_x \bullet I_{std} \bullet MW_{std} \bullet m_x }
$$

$m\_x$, $WM\_x$ and $P\_x$ represent the mass, molar masses and purity of the analysis;

$m\_{std}$, $WM\_{std}$ and $P\_{std}$ represent the mass, molar masses and assay of the standard;

$I\_x$ and $I\_{std}$ define the integrated signal area of the analyte and the standard, respectively.

$N\_x$ and $N\_{std}$ correspond to the number of protons in the integrated signal area of the analyte and the standard.
